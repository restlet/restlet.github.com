Changes log
===========

- 2.5 Release Candidate 1 (12-11-2024)
    - Enhancements
      - Changed the minimum requirements back to Java 8 like for Restlet Framework 2.4 to facilitate upgrade.
      - Transitioned project to native Maven including code base, build and delivery.
      - Artifacts are now published in Maven Central and Sonatype OSS repository for snapshots and only there.
      - Updated all libraries used as dependency for various extensions.
      - RestletFileUpload can now dynamically adapt to Java SE or Java EE environments.
    - Bugs fixed
      - Ensured that all 2.4.4 fixes have been ported forward to the 2.5 branch.
      - Non-serializable internal attributes (status, request, and message) marked as transient,
        this is to allow ResourceException to be serialized, passing over the message and stack-trace
        (which is typically all that is needed to show the error or print it in the log).
    - Misc
      - Replaced separate Android, GAE, Java EE and OSGi editions by a single 'Java' edition
        (tested to work in those various environments).
      - Kept a distinct 'GWT' edition using a forked code base due to many GWT specificities.
      - Removed incubator to rely instead on pull requests.
      - Renamed extension Inject into Guice as it isn't truly generic.
      - Updated the links in all Javadocs file for accuracy.
      - Deprecated GAE, OSGi and RDF extensions for removal in next major release.
      - Deprecated NIO flavor of Restlet API for removal in next major release, with plan to use
        virtual threads instead to achieve additional scalability and reactive behavior.
      - Removed code deprecated in version 2.4, including native Restlet XML configuration mechasism.
        Please use Spring for an alternative approach if needed.
