We have already covered many aspects of the framework. Before you move
on by yourself, let's take a step back and look at two hierarchy
diagrams showing the main concepts covered in this tutorial and their
relationships:

Now, here is the hierarchy with the core Representation classes:

Beside this tutorial, your best source of information will be the
Javadocs available for the [Restlet API](/technical-resources/restlet-framework/javadocs/2.3/jse/api/),
the [Restlet Extensions](/technical-resources/restlet-framework/javadocs/2.3/jse/ext/) and the [Restlet
engine](/technical-resources/restlet-framework/javadocs/2.3/jse/engine/). Have also a look at the
[connectors](/technical-resources/restlet-framework/guide/2.3/core/base/connectors) section that lists
all available client and server connectors and explain how to use and
configure them, and the
[integrations](/technical-resources/restlet-framework/guide/2.3/extensions/editions-matrix) section for
a list of all available extensions providing pluggable features such as
integration with servlet containers, generation of dynamic
representations, etc. You can also post your questions and help others
in our [discussion list](/community/lists).
