# Internal connectors

Here is the list of connectors built-in the Restlet engine:

-   [Local](guide:///core/engine/internal-connectors/local "Local connectors")
-   [FILE](guide:///core/engine/internal-connectors/local "File connector")
-   [CLAP](guide:///core/engine/internal-connectors/clap "CLAP connector")
-   [HTTP](guide:///core/engine/internal-connectors/http "HTTP connector (internal)")
-   [RIAP](guide:///core/engine/internal-connectors/riap "Restlet Internal Access Protocol")
-   Zip

Note that those connectors available in the engine JAR but still need to
be declared in your Restlet component, otherwise your applications won't
be able to use them!
